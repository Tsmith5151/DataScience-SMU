a) Plot the time series. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend? 

b) Use a classical decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices. 

c) Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part (a)? 

d) Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data. 

e) Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 500 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier? 

f) Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series?
